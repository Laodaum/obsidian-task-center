/**
 * Fade + scale + collapse-height animation for removing a card from the view.
 * Uses the Web Animations API — no library, no runtime deps.
 *
 * Collapsing maxHeight + margin to 0 in parallel with the fade is what lets
 * neighbouring cards slide up smoothly instead of snapping after a re-render.
 * Resolves when the animation finishes (or immediately if the element is
 * already detached / interrupted mid-flight).
 *
 * US-127: every card removal flows through this helper so the eye sees
 * a fade + neighbours sliding up rather than a snap-disappearance. In-
 * place mutations don't animate (no element to remove).
 * see USER_STORIES.md
